The factory pattern is a way to create objects in Go by using a separate function called a "factory function" rather than calling the constructor directly. The factory function takes any dependencies that the object needs as arguments and returns a new instance of the object with those dependencies set up.

Here is a simple example of how the factory pattern can be used in Go:
```go
type MyStruct struct {
    dependency1 int
    dependency2 string
}

func NewMyStruct(dep1 int, dep2 string) *MyStruct {
    return &MyStruct{
        dependency1: dep1,
        dependency2: dep2,
    }
}
```

In this example, **MyStruct** is a struct that requires two dependencies: an **int** and a **string**. Instead of calling the struct's constructor directly and passing in the dependencies, the **NewMyStruct** factory function is called with the dependencies as arguments. The factory function then creates a new instance of **MyStruct** with the dependencies set up and returns a pointer to it.

The factory pattern has several benefits:

* It makes the code more readable, by separating the creation of objects and their dependencies.
* It makes it easy to change the dependencies without changing the code that uses the object.
* It makes the code more testable, as it can be easily passed different mock implementations of dependencies.

In summary, the factory pattern is a way of creating objects in Go by using a separate function called a factory function that takes any dependencies required by the object, create an instance of the object with those dependencies and returns the object to the caller. This makes the code more readable, testable and maintainable.
